# Topological Data Analysis Presentation

During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, a group of friends and I, all with an interest in data science and machine learning, formed a study group to expand our knowledge. We conducted weekly presentations, where each member researched and shared their findings on a specific topic. My contribution was a presentation on Topological Data Analysis (TDA), a method that applies concepts from topology to analyze the structure of data.

The presentation has these sections:

1. What is topology?
2. Topolog of data
3. Persistent homology
4. Mapper algorithm
5. Interesting links
